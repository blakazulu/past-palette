## Color the Ancient World

### The Secret Most People Don't Know

Walk into any museum, and you'll see rows of white marble statues and faded pottery. Beautiful, right? But here's the thing - **that's not what they looked like**.

Ancient Greeks painted their statues in bright blues, reds, and golds. Egyptian temples were covered in vivid turquoise and emerald. Roman sculptures had lifelike skin tones and colorful robes.

Time stripped away those colors. But the past wasn't gray - it was *vibrant*.

**Past Palette brings those colors back.**

### What Does It Do?

Snap a photo of an ancient artifact - at a museum, in a textbook, anywhere - and Past Palette will show you what it might have looked like when it was brand new, thousands of years ago.

**It's like having a time machine for color.**

### How To Use It

It's simple:

1. **Take a photo** of any artifact (or upload one from your gallery)
2. **Pick a culture** - Egyptian? Roman? Greek? Mesopotamian?
3. **Tap colorize** - and watch history come alive
4. **Slide to compare** - see the before and after side by side

That's it. Three taps and you're looking at history the way ancient people saw it.

### The Colors of Ancient Civilizations

Each culture had its own palette, its own sacred colors, its own artistic traditions:

**Egyptian**
The colors of gods and pharaohs. Sacred lapis lazuli blue (the color of the sky and the Nile), brilliant gold (the flesh of Ra, the sun god), turquoise, emerald green, and the red of life itself.

**Roman**
Imperial power in color. Deep vermillion red from precious cinnabar, Tyrian purple so expensive only emperors could afford it, gleaming gold leaf, and the distinctive Egyptian blue they traded across the Mediterranean.

**Greek**
The iconic terracotta and black of Athenian pottery. Mediterranean blues for sea gods. Bright pigments on marble statues that we now see only in white.

**Mesopotamian**
The world's first great civilizations. Ultramarine from lapis lazuli traded across deserts, gleaming bronze and gold, the warm red of mud bricks that built ziggurats reaching toward the heavens.

### How Does the AI Actually Work?

Good question. Here's the simple version:

The app uses Google's Gemini AI - think of it as a digital art historian who's studied millions of artifacts and ancient artworks.

**When you take a photo**, the AI looks at shapes, textures, and context. It recognizes patterns - "handles + clay + ancient form" probably means an amphora. "Carved stone + human figure + Egyptian style" probably means a statue from the Nile.

**When it colorizes**, it doesn't just paint over your photo. It creates an entirely new image, guided by historically accurate color palettes. We tell it: "Use the colors ancient Egyptians actually used - the specific blues, golds, and greens from real archaeological evidence."

The result? A colorized version that keeps every detail of the original artifact, but shows it in the colors its creators intended.

### A Note on Accuracy

Let's be honest: **we can't know exactly what every artifact looked like**.

Some pieces have traces of original pigment that scientists can analyze. Others we can only guess at based on similar artifacts, historical texts, and artistic conventions of the time.

Past Palette creates *educated interpretations* - speculative reconstructions based on real archaeological research. Think of them as "what it might have looked like" rather than "what it definitely looked like."

That uncertainty is part of what makes archaeology fascinating. We're piecing together a puzzle with missing pieces, and every colorization is an invitation to imagine the ancient world.
