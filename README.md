# Past Palette

**Color the Ancient World**

## What is Past Palette?

Past Palette uses AI to reveal what ancient artifacts looked like in their original colors. Take a photo of an archaeological artifact, choose a historical culture, and see it come to life with historically accurate colors.

Ancient sculptures, pottery, and artifacts were originally painted in vibrant colors that faded over thousands of years. Past Palette uses AI to reconstruct these lost colors based on archaeological research and historical evidence.

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Take a photo of an artifact or upload an existing image
2. **Choose a Style** - Select a historical color palette (Egyptian, Roman, Greek, etc.)
3. **Colorize** - AI applies historically accurate colors
4. **Compare** - Slide between original and colorized versions

## How the AI Works

The app uses Google's Gemini AI - a model that learned from billions of images paired with descriptions. It doesn't analyze images like traditional software. Instead, it works more like a human who's seen millions of museum pieces.

**For identifying what's in the photo:**
- The AI looks at shapes, textures, and context
- It recognizes patterns from its training ("handles + clay + ancient form" → probably an amphora)
- We ask it: "What is this artifact in 2-3 words?" and it responds based on what it's learned

**For colorization:**
- The AI doesn't "paint over" the photo - it creates a brand new image
- We give it the original photo plus a description of historically accurate colors
- For example: "Use Egyptian colors: lapis lazuli blue, gold, turquoise, emerald green..."
- It generates a colorized version that keeps the artifact's shape but adds period-appropriate colors

Think of it like showing a photo to an art historian who's memorized thousands of artifacts and ancient color palettes - they can recognize what it is and imagine how it originally looked.

## Historical Color Palettes

- **Egyptian** - Sacred lapis blue, gold, turquoise, and emerald green
- **Roman** - Vermillion red, imperial purple, Egyptian blue, and gold leaf
- **Greek** - Terracotta orange, black glaze, and Mediterranean blue
- **Mesopotamian** - Ultramarine, gold, and brick red
- **Weathered** - See how colors might look after centuries of aging

## Important Note

All colorizations are **speculative reconstructions** based on historical research. They represent educated interpretations of how artifacts may have originally appeared, not definitive historical records.
