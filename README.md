# Past Palette

**Color the Ancient World**

## What is Past Palette?

Past Palette uses AI to reveal what ancient artifacts looked like in their original colors. Take a photo of an archaeological artifact, choose a historical culture, and see it come to life with historically accurate colors.

Ancient sculptures, pottery, and artifacts were originally painted in vibrant colors that faded over thousands of years. Past Palette uses AI to reconstruct these lost colors based on archaeological research and historical evidence.

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Take a photo of an artifact or upload an existing image
2. **Choose a Style** - Select a historical color palette (Egyptian, Roman, Greek, etc.)
3. **Colorize** - AI applies historically accurate colors
4. **Compare** - Slide between original and colorized versions

## Historical Color Palettes

- **Egyptian** - Sacred lapis blue, gold, turquoise, and emerald green
- **Roman** - Vermillion red, imperial purple, Egyptian blue, and gold leaf
- **Greek** - Terracotta orange, black glaze, and Mediterranean blue
- **Mesopotamian** - Ultramarine, gold, and brick red
- **Weathered** - See how colors might look after centuries of aging

## Important Note

All colorizations are **speculative reconstructions** based on historical research. They represent educated interpretations of how artifacts may have originally appeared, not definitive historical records.
